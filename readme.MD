NOTE:

1. If react-spring animation doesn't start or behave weirdly on 1st render, make sure to put a FROM property inside of useSpring's instantiation

TODO:

1. Restructure code so when new emote is added, only have to change from one source
2. Look into performance problems with animations on low-end config
   2.1 Try will-change (Tested -> doesn't help much) âœ…
3. Add dragging boundary (selection bounces back if out of bound)
4. Emote not loaded when picked from homepage
5. Try hard coding emote links instead of using generateSelectionLinks()

HOWTO: WHEN ADDING NEW EMOTE PRESETS:

1. EMOTE_DEFAULTS in EmoteAssets
2. emoteSelections[] in EmoteSelectionPanel
3. update list from getEmoteFromParams() in EmoteAssets
4. type EmotePresets in EmoteAssets
